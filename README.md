## ü©∫**CoDoc** : a Code Complexity Analyzer


---

## üìñ **OVERVIEW**

**Codoc** is a developer-focused tool that analyzes source code to evaluate complexity, maintainability, and structure. It identifies areas of the code that are overly complex or deeply nested and provides an AI-powered summary with actionable suggestions. Optionally, users can let the AI attempt to refactor or optimize the code automatically.
